# Andy's Video Player
My name is Andrew A. Anissi, and this is a custom video player designed using HTML5.

I created this app as an experiment in using HTML5 tags, some Javascript logic, and a bit of CSS to design a custom video player. 
Each of the buttons, the volume slider, the time slider, the timer numbers, etc. are all custom designed,
as you will see in this repository.

####I created the functionality of each of these elements in Javascript:

- pause/play button
- time slider (tracks current position in video, allows user to slide it to a different position in the video)
- time elapsed / time remaining
- mute button
- volume sider (shows current volume level, allows user to slide it to a different volume)
- full screen button



The design is not meant to be pretty, as this is more of an exercise in functionality, and getting to the point where I can manipulate the
design elements.

When you load the deployed version, please allow a moment for the video to buffer. It is a public domain video, 
a beautiful feature film entitled, "It's a Wonderful Life", starring James Stewart. One of my favorites.
